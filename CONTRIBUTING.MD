## TRANSLATORS

- In *"/Assets/Resources/Translations"* folder there are .csv files that contains configuration wih strings for any language. Select one you want to edit and open it in proper editor (You can use any kind of csv file editor).<br>
First row indicates as header.  There you'll encouter on of these scenarios:
1. File already contains your country code in header:<br>
If header already contains your country code, you can directly translate texts/strings under your country code column.
2. File doesn't contain your contry code in header:<br>
In this case, you have to simply write your country code in new empty column in first row. Then you can simply translate and write texts/strings underneath.

- After you finish your work and you're ready to submit. Simply create Pull request on github. Alternatively, if you're not familiar with git stuff you can send files trough discord (Direct message). Your changes should be visible in next update.

## Requirements
- For translators: Any kind of .csv editor. Basic text editors are not recommended, due to huge mess.
