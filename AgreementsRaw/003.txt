I really don't want to mess with Privacy Policy and Terms of Service so much, so simply:

Privacy Policy:
Privacy policy describes what personal data game collects and how it (or we) uses these data.

-Unity Analytics - Enabled. Cannot be disabled.
Collects your country for sure and your playing activity. Nothing serious personal. 
For more info, you should refer to Unity engine Analytics privacy policy.

-SOW:Annihilation Analytics - Can be enabled or disabled.
Currently this service targets Singleplayer mode.
If you finish or exit level in Singleplayer, this service sends to database level map you played and stuff that happened in game.
No personal data are being collected. These data will be mostly used to rebalance all units and generally improving game. 
Levels won't be published anywhere. After being processed, they're going to be deleted from database.

-Discord Rich presence SDK - Can be enabled or disabled.
If you have Rich presence enabled in Discord, game status will be displayed under your profile.
SOW:Annihilation use this for interfacing with multiplayer.
If you want to know, how discord collects and uses data trough SDK, you may want refer to: https://discord.com/privacy

Terms of Use:
Currently there are no terms of use, due to no multiplayer.
